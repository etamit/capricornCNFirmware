Firmware for Xiaomi Mi 5s
Sometimes needed for keeping up with LineageOS updates

I will update this at need for me to update LinageOS 15.1 on my phone

This is a continuation of fjtrujy's repo. As he did i'm simply extracting the firmware files from the offical MIUI dev build on http://en.miui.com/download-314.html and adjust the installation script.
I encourage you to reproduce the steps yourself, see more at this wiki.
Use at own risk, just do your backups folks^^
